> JHipster module for converting Postgresql keys from Long to UUID

# Introduction

This is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, that is meant to be used in a JHipster application.

# Prerequisites

As this is a [JHipster](http://jhipster.github.io/) module, we expect you have JHipster and its related tools already installed:

- [Installing JHipster](https://jhipster.github.io/installation.html)

# Installation

To install this module:

```bash
npm install -g generator-jhipster-postgresuuid-converter
```

To update this module:
```bash
npm update -g generator-jhipster-postgresuuid-converter
```

# Usage

No other steps really needed. The generator should hook automatically into your entity generator and convert the code to UUID.
However there are important considerations to be noted.

WARNING: This is a work in progress. Please do not use it in production or use at your own risk.

## Important Considerations

- We assume that Long needs to be converted to UUID so it will convert all Long type parameters to UUID. Please be careful.
- Some tests may not generate completely. That needs to be fixed.
- Elastic Search won't work. Need a fix for that.
- USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. I cannot really cover all cases so if something breaks, sorry.
